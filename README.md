# machine_learning_project
Dense neural network implementation for real estate price prediction

in this project we performed model selection and model evaluation with various machine learning algorithms and eventually submitted the results obtained with our best model on a blind test set for our university's machine learning competition.

We compared ensemble methods (bagging and boosting) with SVM and neural networks models. Based on the validation performance of the models, we selected an AdaBoost ensemble model of 800 decision trees to use on the blind test set and submitted to our University's Machine Learning competition where we acheived second place.
